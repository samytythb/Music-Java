Project is coded in java jdk17 language on IntelliJ

Database is MSSQL Server 2019

To convert the code, we change the url, user, and pass information in the DAO class in the Model package;

The project is coded according to the MVC model

In order to ensure business, security and maintainability, instead of writing sql statements directly, use Stored Procedure

Due to my personal schedule these past few days, I am quite busy with family work, so there are many functions that have not been met

Thank you
